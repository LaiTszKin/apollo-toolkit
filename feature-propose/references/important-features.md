# Important Features Definition

## What it is

Important features are high-value capabilities that significantly improve adoption, trust, retention, or operational reliability after MVP is usable.

## Classification rules

Classify a feature as Important when most of the following are true:

1. The core workflow works without it, but user success is materially weaker.
2. It removes frequent friction for a large share of users.
3. It meaningfully impacts business goals (activation, retention, conversion, safety).
4. It should follow soon after MVP in roadmap priority.

## What it is not

- Purely cosmetic changes with limited user impact
- Deep optimization work without measurable user/business effect
- Experimental ideas with unclear value

## PM check questions

- Does this feature produce measurable product outcome improvement?
- Is it broadly valuable instead of only niche convenience?
