# Enhancement Features Definition

## What it is

Enhancement features are quality-of-life improvements that make the product better, easier, or more delightful but are not essential for core success.

## Classification rules

Classify a feature as Enhancement when most of the following are true:

1. Users can complete key workflows without it.
2. It improves usability, convenience, or flexibility.
3. Value is real but moderate in urgency.
4. It is suitable for iterative delivery after higher-priority tiers.

## What it is not

- Capabilities needed to make the product functionally viable
- Urgent items with major business risk if delayed
- Pure system-level performance remediations tied to SLO breaches

## PM check questions

- Is this primarily a better experience rather than a missing core capability?
- Would delaying it by one release still keep the product viable?
