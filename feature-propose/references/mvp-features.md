# MVP Features Definition

## What it is

MVP features are the minimum set of capabilities required for users to complete the product's core job successfully.

## Classification rules

Classify a feature as MVP when most of the following are true:

1. Without it, primary users cannot complete the main workflow.
2. It removes a critical blocker, risk, or failure in the core journey.
3. It is required to validate product-market fit or core value hypothesis.
4. It should be delivered as a minimal, testable slice.

## What it is not

- Nice-to-have improvements that do not block core usage
- Pure polish changes without direct core-journey impact
- Long-tail edge cases not needed for initial viability

## PM check questions

- If this feature is removed, can users still complete the main job?
- Does this feature directly determine whether the product is usable at all?
