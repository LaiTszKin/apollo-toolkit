  default_prompt: "Use $enhance-existing-features to extend a brownfield feature. If scope is high complexity / critical module / cross-module, create specs and wait for explicit approval before coding. If users answer clarification questions during specs, first update clarification checkboxes, review/adjust spec docs, and obtain approval again before coding. Even without specs, still add tests for unit/property-based/user-critical integration chain/e2e (or record clear N/A reasons)."
