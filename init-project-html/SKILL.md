  Declare the project HTML architecture atlas through `apltk architecture` instead of hand-writing SVG/HTML. Two acceptance criteria gate completion: (1) the macro diagram clearly shows feature × sub-module relationships — data flow, call/return interaction logic, error handling, rollback — all expressed as cross-sub-module edges with kinds `call`, `return`, `data-row`, and `failure`; (2) each sub-module’s internal diagram shows function-level flow (`dataflow` steps may reference a declared function plus `reads`/`writes` of declared variables). The tool owns layout, CSS, pan/zoom, and validation. **Subagents only:** one write-capable subagent per feature declares every intra-feature change; the main agent **waits until all subagents finish**, then wires **only** cross-feature seams. **Exact CLI spelling:** always `apltk architecture --help` — never treat prose in this file as the command list. Anchor every declaration to repo evidence.

# Init Project HTML

## Dependencies

- Required: none (the CLI ships its own layout engine, CSS, and pan/zoom client; `apltk architecture` is installed with this toolkit).
- Conditional: `spec-to-project-html` when the same atlas needs spec-driven refresh — that skill uses the same CLI with `--spec`.
- Optional: `align-project-documents` when `docs/features` already names the user-visible capabilities.
- Fallback: codebase too large for one pass → use the **subagent** strategy below; document scanned roots and explicit omissions in `meta.summary`. **MUST NOT** declare components for code paths that were never read.

## Non-negotiables

### Rule 1 — Use the CLI; never hand-author atlas HTML

The atlas state lives in `resources/project-architecture/atlas/` (`atlas.index.yaml` + per-feature YAMLs). Every change goes through the CLI (exact verbs/flags: **`apltk architecture --help`**). After any mutation, the CLI re-renders `resources/project-architecture/**/*.html` with the correct layout, CSS, pan/zoom, and ARIA — agents **MUST NOT** edit those HTML files by hand or invent additional ones.

### Rule 2 — Sub-module pages describe only themselves; the internal-dataflow diagram is zoomable and structurally typed

What the CLI emits on each sub-module page is fixed in *role* (not in exact flag names — those live in `--help`):

- **Function I/O table** — one row per declared function/side-effect entry point.
- **Variables table** — business-purpose identifiers (`scope` enum and `purpose` text).
- **Internal dataflow** — ordered steps inside a pan/zoom viewport (+/−/Fit), same interaction model as the macro SVG. Steps may attach a declared function name and comma-separated read/write variable names; the renderer shows them as a function pill and read/write chips so **function-to-function flow** and **variable state** are visible in one diagram.
- **Local errors** — symbolic error rows (`when` / `means`).

**Structural constraints** (enforced by `validate`):

- Any function name referenced from a dataflow step must already exist on **that** sub-module (`function` row).
- Any variable name in reads/writes must already exist on **that** sub-module (`variable` row).
- Purely descriptive steps without fn/reads/writes are allowed, but non-trivial sub-modules **MUST** fill the structure so the diagram is not hollow.

Cross-boundary narratives (“I call X”, “Y calls me”) **MUST** be **edges** between `feature/submodule` endpoints with a `kind` of `call`, `return`, `data-row`, or `failure` — never as extra prose on a sub-module page. There is no CLI path to smuggle cross-boundary text onto sub-module pages.

### Rule 3 — Read order: subagents only; wait for all workers before cross-feature wiring

Real production codebases dwarf the main agent’s context. **MUST** use this pattern only:

1. Enumerate the **feature-module list** (slug + entry + boundary resources only) — **no** function-body deep reads at this stage.
2. Dispatch **one write-capable subagent per feature** (every feature in scope that needs atlas work). Each subagent:
   - deep-reads **only** its feature;
   - declares **everything intra-feature** via `apltk architecture` scoped with `--feature <slug>` where the CLI allows (exact scoping flags: **`--help`**): sub-modules, per-sub-module functions / variables / ordered dataflow / errors, and **every intra-feature edge** (calls, returns, data-rows, failures, rollback/compensation **between sub-modules of the same feature**);
   - returns **ONLY** a structured summary of (i) sub-module list (slug + kind + one-line role) and (ii) **outbound boundaries** the orchestrator must wire later (calls / data-rows / failures **to other features’** sub-modules — direction, endpoints, suggested kind/label).

3. **Gate — all subagents complete:** The main agent **MUST NOT** declare any **cross-feature** `edge`, shared `meta` that encodes multi-feature narrative, nor any `actor` that exists only to stitch features together, **until every dispatched subagent has finished** (success **or** an explicit failure report). Partial summaries are for note-taking only — **not** for mutating cross-feature atlas state.

4. After the gate: the main agent aggregates outbound boundary notes, declares **only** cross-feature edges (and optional shared `meta` / `actor` if needed), then runs **`apltk architecture render`** (if batched with `--no-render`) and **`apltk architecture validate`**.

The main agent **MUST NOT** re-read source for a delegated feature and **MUST NOT** re-declare intra-feature components a subagent already owns.

### Rule 4 — Evidence over invention

- **MUST** anchor every declared feature, sub-module, function, variable, dataflow step, and edge to a concrete path / symbol / SQL / config; record scanned roots and any deliberate omissions in `meta.summary` via the CLI (`meta` verbs — flags: **`--help`**).
- **MUST NOT** invent modules, integrations, or sub-modules just because the diagram “looks balanced”. Empty rows are valid; lies are not.

## Standards (summary)

- **Evidence**: every CLI declaration traces to a path/symbol/SQL/config; uncertain areas surface as `TBD` strings or are omitted with a recorded reason.
- **Execution**: shallow feature-module list → subagent fan-out per feature → **wait for all** → cross-feature edges / meta → `validate` → handover.
- **Quality**: macro SVG carries every cross-feature data-row edge that exists in the system; sub-module declarations are self-only; pan/zoom + Fit work in the rendered HTML; `apltk architecture validate` returns OK.
- **Output**: `resources/project-architecture/atlas/` (YAML state) + `resources/project-architecture/**/*.html` (renderer output) — both managed by the CLI.

## Acceptance criteria

The atlas is only complete when both of the following are demonstrably true on the rendered HTML (open `resources/project-architecture/index.html` and one representative sub-module page to verify):

1. **Macro diagram clearly shows the relationships between features and sub-modules**, including:
   - **Data flow** — every cross-feature DB row, queue topic, or cache key hand-off is a `data-row` **edge** between producing and consuming sub-modules (not free-form prose).
   - **Interaction logic** — synchronous request/response paths use paired **`call`** (outbound) and **`return`** edges with a label that names the call site or response shape.
   - **Error handling and rollback** — every failure / compensation / retry path that crosses a sub-module boundary is a **`failure`** edge with a label that names what is rolled back or compensated.
   - No cross-boundary interaction exists **only** in sub-module page prose — it **MUST** appear as an edge on the macro SVG.
2. **Each sub-module’s internal diagram clearly shows the function-level interactions inside the sub-module**, including:
   - **Function-to-function flow** — non-trivial steps reference a declared function on that sub-module.
   - **Variable state transitions** — variables read or written by a step are declared first, then referenced on the step; reading top-to-bottom traces lifecycle.
   - **Local data flow** — ordered steps read as a directed flowchart to the sub-module boundary.

`apltk architecture validate` **MUST** return OK before reporting completion.

## How to use `apltk architecture`

**Authoritative command tree:** run **`apltk architecture --help`** (same output as `apltk architecture help`). **MUST** use that output for every verb, subverb (`add` / `set` / `remove` / `reorder`), and required flag. This skill describes **semantics and constraints** only so documentation does not drift when the CLI adds flags or synonyms.

**Typical global flags** (confirm in `--help`): `--project <root>`, `--spec <spec_dir>` (overlay under `<spec_dir>/architecture_diff/` — see `spec-to-project-html`), `--no-render`, `--no-open`, `--out` (for `diff`). Pass `--no-render` while batching mutations, then **`render`** once before `validate` if you batched.

**Groupings — what each family is for:**

| Family | Purpose | Key constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`open` / `diff` / `render` / `validate` / `undo` / `help`** | View, regenerate, check, revert, discover verbs | **`validate`** before “done”. **`diff`** after spec overlays to compare base vs proposed-after under `docs/plans/**/architecture_diff/`. |
| **`meta` / `actor`** | Macro title, summary, optional top-level actors | Summary is the right place for scanned roots and omissions. |
| **`feature` / `submodule`** | Feature modules and their sub-modules | **Remove** cascades references; in spec overlay mode, rename is usually **remove + add** so `diff` classifies correctly. |
| **`function` / `variable` / `dataflow` / `error`** | Tables + ordered internal flow + local errors | Declare symbols **before** referencing them from `dataflow`. Use **`remove`** (see `--help`) to delete mistaken rows or steps. |
| **`edge`** | Cross- **or** intra-feature seams | **`kind`** ∈ `call` \| `return` \| `data-row` \| `failure`. Intra-feature endpoints land in the feature file; cross-feature endpoints land in the index. Prefer stable **`--id`** on edges you may remove later in spec mode. |

**Cross-feature work timing:** only after **all** feature subagents have returned (Rule 3).

## Workflow

### 1) Whole-repo inventory — list feature modules, not function bodies

Scan the shipped source for **user-visible capabilities** (each one = one feature module): entry routes, CLI commands, UI pages, cron jobs, runners, event handlers, CDC streams. Record only kebab-case slug + one-line user story + boundary points (entry symbol, outbound DB tables / queue topics / external services).

- **Pause →** Is the list actually complete? Note skipped roots with reason; no silent skips.
- **Pause →** Did I dive into function bodies here? Roll back — keep only structural notes.

### 2) Subagent fan-out — workers own features; orchestrator owns cross-feature seams **after** all workers finish

Dispatch one **write-capable** subagent per feature. Hand each subagent: its feature slug, the feature-module list from step 1 (so it knows other features’ slugs for outbound edges), and **`apltk architecture --help`** as the flag reference.

> **Feature `<slug>` subagent contract**
> - Read every sub-module of this feature.
> - Declare the feature and its sub-modules (`feature` / `submodule` — exact flags: **`--help`**).
> - For every sub-module: add **function**, **variable**, ordered **dataflow**, and **error** rows as needed.
> - For every intra-feature interaction between sub-modules, add an **edge** whose endpoints stay **inside** this feature.
> - Run **`apltk architecture validate`** before returning (same project root; use **`--help`** for project/spec flags).
> - **Return ONLY**: (i) sub-module list (slug + kind + one-line role), (ii) outbound boundaries to *other* features’ sub-modules (direction + edge kind + suggested label). No source dumps.

**Orchestrator — after every subagent has completed:**

```bash
apltk architecture meta set --title "..." --summary "..." --no-render
# only when an actor is shared across multiple features:
apltk architecture actor add --id <id> --label "..." --no-render
# one edge per cross-feature interaction reported by the subagents:
apltk architecture edge add --from <featA>/<subA> --to <featB>/<subB> --kind call|return|data-row|failure --label "..." --no-render
apltk architecture render
apltk architecture validate
```

The main agent **MUST NOT** re-declare a subagent’s intra-feature components, and **MUST NOT** open source files for any feature it delegated.

### 3) Handover report

Report: feature count, sub-module count, macro edge counts (call / return / data-row / failure), uncovered paths + reasons, confirmation that **all subagents completed before cross-feature wiring**, and the location of the rendered atlas (`resources/project-architecture/index.html`).

## Sample hints

- Multiple SQL paths on `service ↔ db` → one **`edge`** per SQL path so the macro shows distinct strokes.
- Retry loops between `service ↔ generator(pure)` → **`call` / `return`** pair on the macro plus ordered **`dataflow`** steps on the service that show retry budget and persistence.
- Cross-feature DB hand-off (A writes, B reads) → both sides declare DB-oriented functions, then a **`data-row`** edge from producer to consumer.
- Rollback / compensation across sub-modules → **`failure`** edge with an explicit label; cleanup *inside* a single sub-module belongs in ordered **`dataflow`** steps.
- Third-party systems → **`external`** kind sub-modules so the trust boundary is visible in styling.
